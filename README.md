## SECTION 1: PROJECT TITLE
### WingSpan - Enhancing Birdwatching with AI 

------------


## SECTION 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
#### PREFACE
Singapore's diverse avian population often goes unnoticed during urbanization. To address this, we introduce an innovative AI chatbot application called WingSpan designed to enhance birdwatching experiences. This report outlines the problem, the opportunity it presents, our proposed solution, design techniques employed, and closing thoughts on the project. PROBLEM

#### PROBLEM
Despite Singapore's rich bird species, there is a lack of accessible tools for bird identification and locating birdwatching spots. Traditional methods are time-consuming and require expertise, while information on bird hotspots is often scattered and outdated and is not easily accessible.

#### OPPURTUNITY
Advancements in AI, including GPT-4 and ML models, offer an opportunity to revolutionize birdwatching. By leveraging these technologies, we can create a user-friendly platform that simplifies bird identification and enables easy discovery of birdwatching spots, fostering greater appreciation for Singapore's natural environment.

#### SOLUTION
Our solution is an AI chatbot called WingSpan, which offers comprehensive functionalities: \
• Bird Information: This feature provides users with extensive information about various bird species, including their habitat and conservation status, enabling users to expand their ornithological knowledge. \
• Bird Identification by Description: Users can input descriptions of birds they encounter, and the system will assist in identifying the species, aiding in the exploration and discovery of avian life. \
• Bird Identification from Photos: This feature allows users to upload photos of birds for identification, leveraging visual data for species recognition. \
• Bird Spotting Predictions: Utilizing historical data, the application predicts the likelihood of spotting specific birds, aiding enthusiasts in planning their birdwatching activities. \
• Park Recommendation: By analysing data on bird populations and activity, the system recommends parks for birdwatching. \
• Bird Abundance Heatmap in Singapore: An interactive heatmap feature displays areas of high bird abundance within Singapore, serving as a strategic tool for birdwatching planning. \

#### DESIGN TECHNIQUE
WingSpan incorporates several design techniques to ensure a seamless and enjoyable birdwatching experience: \ 
• User-Friendly Interface: The chatbot interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to interact effortlessly with the application. \
• Natural Language Processing: Leveraging GPT-4's language understanding capabilities, WingSpan interprets user queries and descriptions accurately, enhancing the interaction experience. \
• Image Recognition: WingSpan utilizes GPT-4 Vision Preview's image recognition capabilities to accurately identify bird species from user-uploaded images, providing instant results. \
• Personalized Recommendations: WingSpan offers personalized recommendations for bird sightings and park locations based on user preferences, ensuring tailored suggestions for each user. \
• Data-Driven Bird Heat Map: WingSpan provides a bird heat map generated by ML models that predict where birds will be sighted based on historical data for each week. While not real-time, this feature offers valuable insights into bird activity patterns. \

#### CLOSING THOUGHTS
WingSpan represents a significant step forward in leveraging AI and machine learning to enhance birdwatching experiences. By addressing the existing challenges of bird identification and locating birdwatching spots, WingSpan empowers both seasoned enthusiasts and newcomers to explore and appreciate Singapore's avian diversity.
Through intuitive design and advanced technology, WingSpan not only simplifies the process of bird identification but also encourages users to engage with nature in a meaningful way. By fostering greater accessibility and interest in birdwatching, WingSpan contributes to the conservation and appreciation of Singapore's natural environment.
As we continue to refine and expand WingSpan's capabilities, we are excited about the potential to inspire more people to connect with the natural world and contribute to the preservation of our avian habitats. With ongoing updates and enhancements, WingSpan will remain a valuable tool for birdwatchers, promoting conservation efforts and enriching the experience of exploring Singapore's vibrant birdlife.
