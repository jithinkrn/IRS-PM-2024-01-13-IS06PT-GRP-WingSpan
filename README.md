## SECTION 1: PROJECT TITLE
### WingSpan - Enhancing Birdwatching with AI 

------------


## SECTION 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Despite Singapore's rich bird species, there is a lack of accessible tools for bird identification and locating birdwatching spots. Traditional methods are time-consuming, require expertise, and the available information on bird hotspots is often scattered and outdated. However, advancements in AI, including GPT-4 and machine learning models and other machine learning algorithms, offer a significant opportunity to revolutionize birdwatching. By leveraging these technologies, we created a user-friendly platform that simplifies bird identification and enables easy discovery of birdwatching spots, fostering a greater appreciation for Singapore's natural environment

#### SOLUTION
Our solution is an AI chatbot called WingSpan, which offers comprehensive functionalities: 

• Bird Information: This feature provides users with extensive information about various bird species, including their habitat and conservation status, enabling users to expand their ornithological knowledge. \
• Bird Identification by Description: Users can input descriptions of birds they encounter, and the system will assist in identifying the species, aiding in the exploration and discovery of avian life. \
• Bird Identification from Photos: This feature allows users to upload photos of birds for identification, leveraging visual data for species recognition. \
• Bird Spotting Predictions: Utilizing historical data, the application predicts the likelihood of spotting specific birds, aiding enthusiasts in planning their birdwatching activities. \
• Park Recommendation: By analysing data on bird populations and activity, the system recommends parks for birdwatching. \
• Bird Abundance Heatmap in Singapore: An interactive heatmap feature displays areas of high bird abundance within Singapore, serving as a strategic tool for birdwatching planning. 

#### DESIGN TECHNIQUE
WingSpan incorporates several design techniques to ensure a seamless and enjoyable birdwatching experience:  

• User-Friendly Interface: The chatbot interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to interact effortlessly with the application. \
• Natural Language Processing: Leveraging GPT-4's language understanding capabilities, WingSpan interprets user queries and descriptions accurately, enhancing the interaction experience. \
• Image Recognition: WingSpan utilizes GPT-4 Vision Preview's image recognition capabilities to accurately identify bird species from user-uploaded images, providing instant results. \
• Personalized Recommendations: WingSpan offers personalized recommendations for bird sightings and park locations based on user preferences, ensuring tailored suggestions for each user. \
• Data-Driven Bird Heat Map: WingSpan provides a bird heat map generated by ML models that predict where birds will be sighted based on historical data for each week. While not real-time, this feature offers valuable insights into bird activity patterns.
