## SECTION 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
#### PREFACE
Singapore's diverse avian population often goes unnoticed during urbanization. To address this, we introduce an innovative AI chatbot application called WingSpan designed to enhance birdwatching experiences. This report outlines the problem, the opportunity it presents, our proposed solution, design techniques employed, and closing thoughts on the project. PROBLEM

#### PROBLEM
Despite Singapore's rich bird species, there is a lack of accessible tools for bird identification and locating birdwatching spots. Traditional methods are time-consuming and require expertise, while information on bird hotspots is often scattered and outdated and is not easily accessible.

#### OPPURTUNITY
Advancements in AI, including GPT-4 and ML models, offer an opportunity to revolutionize birdwatching. By leveraging these technologies, we can create a user-friendly platform that simplifies bird identification and enables easy discovery of birdwatching spots, fostering greater appreciation for Singapore's natural environment.

#### SOLUTION
Our solution is an AI chatbot called WingSpan, which offers comprehensive functionalities: \
• Bird Information: This feature provides users with extensive information about various bird species, including their habitat and conservation status, enabling users to expand their ornithological knowledge. \
• Bird Identification by Description: Users can input descriptions of birds they encounter, and the system will assist in identifying the species, aiding in the exploration and discovery of avian life. \
• Bird Identification from Photos: This feature allows users to upload photos of birds for identification, leveraging visual data for species recognition. \
• Bird Spotting Predictions: Utilizing historical data, the application predicts the likelihood of spotting specific birds, aiding enthusiasts in planning their birdwatching activities. \
• Park Recommendation: By analysing data on bird populations and activity, the system recommends parks for birdwatching. \
• Bird Abundance Heatmap in Singapore: An interactive heatmap feature displays areas of high bird abundance within Singapore, serving as a strategic tool for birdwatching planning. \
