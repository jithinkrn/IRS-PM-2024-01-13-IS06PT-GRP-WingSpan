## SECTION 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
#### PREFACE
Singapore's diverse avian population often goes unnoticed during urbanization. To address this, we introduce an innovative AI chatbot application called WingSpan designed to enhance birdwatching experiences. This report outlines the problem, the opportunity it presents, our proposed solution, design techniques employed, and closing thoughts on the project. PROBLEM

#### PROBLEM
Despite Singapore's rich bird species, there is a lack of accessible tools for bird identification and locating birdwatching spots. Traditional methods are time-consuming and require expertise, while information on bird hotspots is often scattered and outdated and is not easily accessible. OPPORTUNITY

#### OPPURTUNITY
Advancements in AI, including GPT-4 and ML models, offer an opportunity to revolutionize birdwatching. By leveraging these technologies, we can create a user-friendly platform that simplifies bird identification and enables easy discovery of birdwatching spots, fostering greater appreciation for Singapore's natural environment.
