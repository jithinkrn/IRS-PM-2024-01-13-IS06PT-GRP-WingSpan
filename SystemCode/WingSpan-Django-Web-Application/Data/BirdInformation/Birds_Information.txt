Swinhoe’s Snipe
Scientific Name: Gallinago megala
Malay Name: Berkik Siberia Selatan
Chinese Name: 大沙锥
Range: Breeds in south-central Siberia and northern Mongolia; a separate disjunct population breeds in Ussuriland, in the Russian far east. Winters in parts of southern and eastern China, the Indian subcontinent, southeast Asia, and northern Australia.
Taxonomy: Monotypic.
Size: 27-29 cm
Identification: The rarest of three Gallinago snipes in Singapore, but possibly overlooked due to difficulty in separation from Pin-tailed. From Common Snipe, most obviously differentiated by a lack of clear white trailing edge to the secondaries, shorter bill and larger-headed appearance (see that species for more differences). Apart from a series of overlapping and weakly defined separation features, only truly differentiable from Pin-tailed Snipe with a clear view of the spread tail (or measurements in the hand). On this species, only the outermost pair of tail feathers are narrow (varying from 2 to 4 mm wide), while the rest gradually increase in width towards the central feathers (giving the impression of at least two intermediate-width tail feathers outside the central few, while Pin-tailed shows one intermediate-width feather between the central tail feathers and the six to nine pin-like feathers on the outertail).
Similar looking species: Pin-tailed Snipe, Common Snipe
Habitat: Damp grasslands, edges of waterbodies, and muddy freshwater marshes.
Behaviour/Ecology: Flushed Swinhoe's Snipes are often silent. A snipe that is silent when flushed is more likely Swinhoe's than one that calls, but this is only suggestive. Vocal differences between the two species are poorly understood and more study may reveal that differentiation by flight calls is possible.
Local Status: Rare migrant
Conservation Status: Least Concern (BirdLife International 2016)

Pin-tailed Snipe
Scientific Name: Gallinago stenura
Malay Name: Berkik Ekor Jarum
Chinese Name: 针尾沙锥
Alternative Name(s): Pintail Snipe
Range: Breeds from central to east Russia as well as in Mongolia; winters in the Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia.
Taxonomy: Monotypic.
Size: 25-27 cm
Identification: One of three difficult-to-identify Gallinago snipes in Singapore. From Common Snipe, most obviously differentiated by a lack of clear white trailing edge to the secondaries, shorter bill and larger-headed appearance (see that species for more differences). Apart from a long list of overlapping and weakly defined separation features, only truly differentiable from Swinhoe's Snipe with a clear view of the spread tail (or measurements in the hand). This species has one (vs. more than one in Swinhoe's) intermediate-width feather between the wide central tail feathers and the eight (or, less frequently, six, seven, or nine) pin-like feathers on the outer-tail. These feathers are referred to as "pins" as they are extremely narrow, less than 2 mm wide. On Swinhoe's, only the outermost pair of tail feathers are narrow (varying from 2 to 4 mm wide), while the rest gradually increase in width towards the central feathers (giving the impression of at least two intermediate-width tail feathers outside the central few, while Pin-tailed shows only one when tail is fully spread).
Similar looking species: Swinhoe's Snipe, Common Snipe
Habitat: Damp grasslands, edges of waterbodies, and muddy freshwater marshes.
Behaviour/Ecology: Flushed Pin-tailed Snipes tend to vocalize more than flushed Swinhoe's Snipes; a snipe that is silent when flushed is more likely Swinhoe's than Pin-tailed, but this is only suggestive. Vocal differences between the two species are poorly understood and more study may reveal that differentiation by flight calls is possible.
Local Status: Uncommon migrant
Conservation Status: Least Concern (BirdLife International 2016)
Location: Any area of suitable habitat, such as Jurong Lake Gardens, Lim Chu Kang Lane 3, and Kranji Marshes.

Common Snipe
Scientific Name: Gallinago gallinago
Malay Name: Berkik Kipas Erasia
Chinese Name: 扇尾沙锥
Range: Breeds across the Palearctic from central Europe to east Siberia, winters to western Europe, tropical Africa, the Middle East and Indian subcontinent, as well as southeast Asia.
Taxonomy: Polytypic. Subspecies are: faeroeensis, gallinago.
Local Subspecies: gallinago
Size: 25-27 cm
Identification: The easiest to identify of the three snipes that winter locally; several distinctive features can be used to reliably tell this species apart from both Pin-tailed and Swinhoe's. Structurally, Common is distinctly sleeker, smaller-headed, and longer-billed than both those species; in plumage, is obviously more "contrasty", especially evident on the facial feathers (loral line especially darker and more prominent in Common). Most easily distinguished in flight, where broad white trailing-edge to secondaries and uneven markings on underwing (unlike Pin-tailed and Swinhoe's, which have evenly-barred underwing patterns) separate this species.
Similar looking species: Pin-tailed Snipe, Swinhoe's Snipe
Habitat: Damp grasslands with areas of tall grass and muddy freshwater marshes.
Behaviour/Ecology: Alarm call, normally heard when flushed, is a sharp "skaap"; its zigzag flight when flushed can also be used, in combination with other features, to separate this species from the other snipes found locally.
Local Status: Uncommon migrant
Conservation Status: Least Concern (BirdLife International 2019)
Location: Kranji Marshes, Marina East, and any other area with suitable habitat.

Green Sandpiper
Scientific Name: Tringa ochropus
Malay Name: Kedidi-Hijau Erasia
Chinese Name: 白腰草鹬
Range: Breeds across the Palearctic, from Scandinavia east to eastern Siberia; winters in western Europe, tropical Africa, the Indian Subcontinent, southern China, and southeast Asia.
Taxonomy: Monotypic.
Size: 21-24 cm
Identification: A medium-sized sandpiper with dark upperparts and contrasting clean white underparts. Most likely to be confused with Common Sandpiper and Wood Sandpiper. Best told from Common Sandpiper by longer bill, significantly longer legs, and dark (rather than white) outer breast which forms a dark "strip" across the whole breast (while Common appears to show a "bib"). From Wood Sandpiper, told by noticeably darker upperparts with less pale spotting, much darker breast, and supercilium which does not extend behind the eye (or only faintly present behind the eye, at best).
Similar looking species: Wood Sandpiper, Common Sandpiper
Habitat: Inland freshwater areas, such as canals and marshes; also intertidal areas on occasion.
Behaviour/Ecology: Typically associates with Wood Sandpipers in freshwater habitat, where it is normally difficult to tell apart from that species. Stance and feeding action closer to Wood than to Common Sandpiper.
Local Status: Vagrant
Conservation Status: Least Concern (BirdLife International 2016)

Grey-tailed Tattler
Scientific Name: Tringa brevipes
Malay Name: Kedidi-Kacau Asia
Chinese Name: 灰尾漂鹬
Range: Breeds in northern Siberia, winters south through the Malay Peninsula, Phillippines, and coastal Indonesia and Australia.
Taxonomy: Monotypic.
Size: 24-27 cm
Identification: A rather stockily-built sandpiper; in breeding plumage (which is sometimes retained until October or even later), shows grey upperparts, underparts white with wide, thin chevron-shaped markings across breast, flank and vent. In non-breeding plumage, white throat and brownish-grey wash over breast and upper belly; rest of underparts clean white. Differentiated from other similar species by combination of short yellow legs (compared to Common Redshank, Common Greenshank, Marsh Sandpiper, and all other Tringa sandpipers except Nordmann's Greenshank, which have longer legs); short, blunt-tipped bill (compared to Terek Sandpiper and much rarer Nordmann's Greenshank, which have upturned bills).
Similar looking species: Spotted Redshank, Common Redshank, Nordmann's Greenshank, Wood Sandpiper, Terek Sandpiper, Common Sandpiper
Habitat: Intertidal mudflats, mangroves, occasionally inland wetlands.

Size: 22-25 cm
Identification: A medium-sized wader with a distinctive pencil-thin bill and long legs. Like Common Greenshank, lightly spotted (breeding plumage) or clean white (non-breeding plumage) below, with greyish-brown upperparts and yellow legs. Differs, however, from that species by its thin and straight (rather than slightly upturned) bill; overall, Marsh is smaller-bodied and more elegant.
Similar looking species: Common Greenshank
Habitat: Mudflats, sandflats, and brackish lagoons.
Behaviour/Ecology: Joins flocks of other waders; often found with Common Greenshanks. Normally wades in shallow water.
Local Status: Rare migrant

Taxonomy: Polytypic. Subspecies are: falcinellus, sibirica.
Local Subspecies: sibirica
Size: 16-18 cm
Identification: A small wader with short legs and a somewhat rounded appearance. In all plumages, can be distinguished from other waders by relatively long bill decurved at its tip and distinctive split supercilium. Slightly larger Curlew Sandpiper and Dunlin have a more evenly decurved bill, lack the split supercilium, and, when in non-breeding colors, display less contrasting upperpart plumage. Red-necked and Little Stint are smaller and have shorter bills which lack the decurved tip. In breeding plumage, Broad-billed Sandpipers show rufous fringes to upperpart feathers and a more contrasting supercilium.
Similar looking species: Red-necked Stint, Curlew Sandpiper, Little Stint
Habitat: Mudflats, sandflats, and brackish lagoons.
Behaviour/Ecology: Walks slowly while feeding, scanning for prey from side to side; occasionally probes. Sometimes joins flocks of other waders.

Crested Honey Buzzard
Scientific Name: Pernis ptilorhynchus
Malay Name: Helang-Lebah Asia
Chinese Name: 凤头蜂鹰
Range: Breeds in southwest and northeast China through east Asia to Japan. This population (orientalis) migrates south to southeast Asia. Also present from the Indian subcontinent through southeast Asia, east to the Philippines. The Sundaic population (torquatus) is a non-breeding visitor to Singapore.
Taxonomy: Polytypic. Subspecies are: orientalis, ruficollis, philippensis, torquatus, ptilorhynchus, palawanensis.
Local Subspecies: orientalis (migrant), torquatus (resident)
Size: 55-65 cm
Identification: A vary variable species with plumage colours ranging from white, rufous to black. Has a small pigeon-like head distinct both when perched and in flight. The local torquatus race has a distinct crest. Often confused with the Changeable Hawk-eagle, from which it can be told apart by its smaller head, less rounded (longer and more rectangular) wings, longer tail, and unfeathered tarsus (hard to see when perched). Common and Eastern Buzzard likewise rounder body, proportionally shorter tail and rounder wings as well.

Eastern Buzzard
Scientific Name: Buteo japonicus
Malay Name: Helang-Gempal Biasa
Chinese Name: 普通鵟
Range: Breeds in eastern Siberia through Sakhalin to Hokkaido, winters south to continental southeast Asia. Resident in Japan with endemic taxa in the Izu and Bonin islands, as well as the Daito Islands.
Taxonomy: Polytypic. Subspecies are: burmanicus, japonicus, toyoshimai, oshiroi.
Size: 51-57 cm
Identification: Buteo buzzards have a roundish body and in flight, is disitnct with roung wings and a proportionally short tail. In Singapore very difficult to distinguish from the Common Buzzard, but Buteo buzzards with primarily white base colour on the underparts with strongly contrasting black carpal patch are thought to be of this species.
Similar looking species: Crested Honey Buzzard, Jerdon's Baza, Changeable Hawk-Eagle, Common Buzzard
Habitat: Open country.
Behaviour/Ecology: Taxonomy of the Buteo buzzards very confused, with various authors treating this and the Common Buzzard differently. Usually found in open country, though not very frequently observed wintering in Singapore. When hunting, it has a habit of soaring against the wind and staying completely stationary in the air, looking downwards to search for its prey. This behaviour however is almost never observed in Singapore due to the lack of suitable habitats.

Local Subspecies: vulpinus
Size: 39-47 cm
Identification: The Buteo buzzards present a stocky body, broad wings and a tail when in flight. Difficult to distinguish from Eastern Buzzard, but said to be darker brown overall, with dark carpal patch not contrasting with the rest of the wing as strongly. Can come in three distinct morphs: brown, rufous and dark. Brown morph with solid, brown wing lining and often possessing a pale breast 'belt' that separates the dark plumage of the belly from the strong upper breast streaking; tail also strongly barred.

Behaviour/Ecology: Population in Singapore originated from introduced escaped individuals around the mid 1930s. A massive range expansion of this species occured through the Peninsula in the past century while the locally introduced population was expanding massively. This self-introduced population eventually reached Singapore some time after the 1980s to merge with the local (introduced) population. The current population in Singapore hence has a mixture of introduced and self-introduced ancestry. This species has also been introduced to various places globally and is listed in "100 of the World's Worst Invasive Alien Species" by the IUCN.

Habitat: Wide range of open habitats e.g. fields, agricultural, seashore.
Behaviour/Ecology: Roosts in staggering numbers and forming murmurations. A very adaptable species, as seen from the sweeping colonisation of North America from a single introduction locality. Moults by wear; pale feather tips acquired in non-breeding plumage wears away in spring to produce the glossy blackish breeding plumage.
Local Status: Vagrant
Conservation Status: Least Concern (BirdLife International 2019)

White’s Thrush
Scientific Name: Zoothera aurea
Malay Name: Murai-Tanah Bersisik Biasa
Chinese Name: 虎斑地鸫
Range: Breeds from Siberia to Korea, Japan, and winters to South China and Indochina.
Taxonomy: Polytypic. Subspecies are: aurea, toratugumi.
Local Subspecies: aurea
Size: 29-30.5 cm
Identification: Distinguished from all other thrushes in Singapore by light brown upperparts and white underparts with unique dense dark scales. Female Siberian Thrush is somewhat similar, but has contrasting white throat and supercilium, face, and a dark moustachial stripe, and lacks the dense upperpart scaling of this species. The White’s Thrush is also similar looking to many other thrushes from the same genus (Zoothera) that do not occur in Singapore; particular care is required to distinguish it from the near identical Scaly Thrush Z. dauma that has no records in Singapore but is also found in the region, albeit as a short-distance migrant. Scaly Thrush is comparatively weaker- and shorter-billed, but the most reliable method to distinguish the two species is by the wing formula, which is most easily determined in the hand. Excellent field photos may also be sufficient, as discussed here. In White's Thrush, the second-outermost primary (p2) is between the lengths of p4 and p5, while in Scaly Thrush p2 is shorter and between p5 and p6 instead.
Similar looking species: Siberian Thrush
Habitat: Forest and suitable wooded areas.
Behaviour/Ecology: Generally prefers forests and wooded area that has dense leaf litter where it forages. Like many other thrushes, this species is also often observed feeding on fruiting trees, and can stay still and remain very inconspicuously perched on trees when not foraging. (Note: some sources list the presence of 14 tail feathers as diagnostic for White's Thrush, but this may not be reliable.)
Local Status: Vagrant
Conservation Status: Least Concern (BirdLife International 2019)

Black Redstart
Scientific Name: Phoenicurus ochruros
Malay Name: Murai-Jingga Hitam
Chinese Name: 赭红尾鸲
Range: Western races gibraltariensis and aterrimus generally resident in Europe and North Africa. Eastern races essentially occupy the remainder of Eurasia, with ochruros and semirufus occurring as short-distance migrants in parts of Turkey and the Middle East. But most likely to occur as vagrants in Southeast Asia and Singapore are phoenicuroides and rufiventris. "Eastern Black Redstart", comprising these two subspecies, is a proposed split. Subspecies phoenicuroides is a medium-distance migrant breeding in central Asia and wintering in the Arabian Peninsula, northeastern Africa and south Asia; records of vagrancy in western Europe probably refer to this subspecies. Subspecies rufiventris is a short-distance migrant that breeds further east in China and winters in south Asia.
Taxonomy: Polytypic. Subspecies are: gibraltariensis, ochruros, semirufus, phoenicuroides, murinus, rufiventris.
Size: 14-15 cm
Identification: Adult males of race phoenicuroides show grey-black back, head, and upper breast contrasting with orange-rufous lower breast, belly, and vent; rufiventris is similar, but larger, more richly-toned rufous below, and blacker on upperparts. Female is grey-brown on upperparts and underparts. First-winter males are highly variable; some attain near-adult plumage by autumn, while most retain a female-like plumage through the winter. Separated from Daurian Redstart in all plumages by the lack of white wing-spot, which is always present in that species. Most likely confusion species is Common Redstart, which breeds from western Europe to far northwestern China and winters in sub-Saharan Africa. It differs by being noticeably paler in all plumages and always shows some orange-rufous tones on underparts above the vent. The spacing of primaries, visible on photos showing a back view, is the most reliable separator. However, an in-depth discussion of this feature is impossible here; instead see Laurens B Steijn's article in Dutch Birding 27(3), linked in the references below. Adult males separated from Hodgson's Redstart (short-distance migrant in China and northern Myanmar) by lack of white wing-spots; females and first-winter birds of that species are noticeably paler and browner, with less grey tones.
Similar looking species: Daurian Redstart
